# CodeUp-DS-Zillow-Zestimate-Project

### Project Goals
* Identify key features that can be used to create an effective predictive model
* Use features to develop a machine learning model that predicts the Zestimate LogErrors

#### Our initial hypothesis is that drivers of LogErrors will be a combination of elements/features that cause an increase of Zestimate LogError.

### The Plan
* Aquire data from the CodeUp database
* Prepare data for exploration by creating tailored columns from existing data

#### Explore data in search of drivers by asking the basic following questions:

* What is the distribution of LogError by county?
* What features should we investigate?

#### Develop a Model to predict LogError

* Use drivers identified to build predictive models of different types
* Evaluate models on train and validate data samples
* Select the best model based on RSME
* Evaluate the best model on test data samples

#### Draw conclusions

### Steps to Reproduce
* Clone this repo.
* Confirm variables from user env.py file as
        username = 'your user name', 
        password = 'your password', 
        host = 'data.codeup.com'password pwd, etc.)
* Acquire the data from CodeUp database
* Put the data in the file containing the cloned repo.
* Run notebook
